# Orphanage and Child Management System

Welcome to the Orphanage and Child Management System project repository. This system is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing orphanages and child-related information. It comprises a frontend built with React.js, a backend powered by Node.js, and utilizes a PostgreSQL database to store and manage data efficiently.

## Project Overview

### Frontend (React.js)

#### User Interface
The frontend of the Orphanage and Child Management System is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users to perform various operations seamlessly.

#### Features
1. **User Authentication:** Users can register, login, and securely manage their accounts. Robust authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure data security.

2. **Child Management:** The system allows orphanages to maintain records of children, including their personal information, medical history, and educational status.

3. **Adoption Management:** Users can track the adoption process, manage adoption requests, and view adoption records.

4. **Donation Tracking:** Orphanages can record and monitor donations, including financial contributions, supplies, and sponsorships.

5. **User Roles:** Different user roles, such as administrators, staff, and donors, are defined with appropriate permissions and access levels.

### Backend (Node.js)

#### Server and APIs
The backend of the system is built using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime. It serves as the core of the application, handling user requests, business logic, and database interactions.

#### Features
1. **RESTful API Endpoints:** The backend defines a set of RESTful API endpoints to handle various user interactions, including user authentication, child management, adoption requests, and donation tracking.

2. **Database Integration:** Node.js interacts with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data related to orphanages, children, users, donations, and adoptions.

3. **Security:** Stringent security measures, such as data encryption, input validation, and role-based access control, are implemented to protect sensitive data and ensure system integrity.

4. **Logging and Error Handling:** The backend logs activities and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

### Database (PostgreSQL)

#### Data Storage and Management
The PostgreSQL database serves as the backbone of the Orphanage and Child Management System, efficiently storing and managing data.

#### Features
1. **Tables:** The database schema consists of tables for orphanages, children, users, donations, adoptions, and other relevant data entities.

2. **Data Integrity:** Data integrity constraints, such as foreign keys, indexes, and unique constraints, are enforced to maintain data accuracy and consistency.

3. **Query Optimization:** SQL queries are optimized to ensure fast and efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
